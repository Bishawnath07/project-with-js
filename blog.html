        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">1. What is DOOM and what is the purpose of DOOM ?</h2>
        <p><span class="text-rose-500">Answers:</span> DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. How will you select HTML element using DOOM ? Name of the methods ?</h2>
        <p><span class="text-rose-500">Answers:</span>  There are six methods for selecting an element from a JavaScript document.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. getElementById – search element by element_id</li>
            <li>2. getElementsByTagName – search element by tag name</li>
            <li>3. getElementsByClassName – search element by class name  </li>
            <li>4. getElementsByName – search element by name attribute   </li>
            <li>5. querySelector – returns the first element that matches the specified selector</li>
            <li>6. querySelectorAll – returns elements that match the specified selector</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. What is even buble ?</h2>
        <p><span class="text-rose-500">Answers:</span>  The bubbles read-only property of the Event interface indicates whether the event bubbles up through the DOM tree or not.Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element. </p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. What id callback function and why will you use it ?</h2>
        <p><span class="text-rose-500">Answers:</span>  A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors. In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed. </p>
